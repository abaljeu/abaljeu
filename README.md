With a lifelong passionate love of software development since I was a child programming things in BASIC on the Commodore 64.
Combined with a love of mathematics, I especially like learning ways to write efficient and reliable code.

If you want to see my skill, I can privately show code I created with my company that includes:
* high-performance C++ code for CAD (3D modelling)
* large C# projects (client-server, custom UI, Office integration)
* AI software created ground-up in Prolog.

(My challenge is in marketing, finding the right fit for this kind of tech.)

This github has some hobby code: small self-developed, and open-source clones aimed at expanding my horizons.  Very basic stuff compared to the million-line projects I've managed and coded.
